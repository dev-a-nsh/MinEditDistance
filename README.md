Minimum Edit Distance Calculator
This is a simple, client-side web application that calculates the Levenshtein distance (also known as Edit Distance) between two input strings. The Levenshtein distance is the minimum number of single-character edits (insertions, deletions, or substitutions) required to transform one string into another.

The entire application runs directly in the user's browser, built with standard web technologies: HTML for structure, Tailwind CSS for styling, and JavaScript for the core logic.

**Features**
It efficiently computes the minimum edit distance between 2 given strings

It provides an User-Friendly Interface through easy input and output 

Client-Side Operation: No server-side dependencies; everything runs directly in your web browser.

It can adapt seamlessly to different screen sizes for a consistent experience on desktop and mobile devices.

**Technical Details**

This project leverages the following technologies:

HTML5: Provides the foundational structure and content of the web page.

CSS (Tailwind CSS): Used for rapid and responsive styling, ensuring a clean and modern design.

JavaScript: Powers the interactive elements and implements the core algorithm.

**Levenshtein Distance Algorithm**

The heart of this application is the levenshteinDistance(s1, s2) JavaScript function. It employs a dynamic programming approach to compute the distance, following these steps:

Initialization: A 2D array (matrix) dp is created. dp[i][j] will store the Levenshtein distance between the first i characters of s1 and the first j characters of s2.

Base Cases: The first row (dp[i][0]) and first column (dp[0][j]) are initialized. dp[i][0] represents the cost of transforming the first i characters of s1 into an empty string (requiring i deletions). Similarly, dp[0][j] represents the cost of transforming an empty string into the first j characters of s2 (requiring j insertions).

Matrix Filling: The algorithm iterates through the rest of the matrix, calculating dp[i][j] based on the minimum of three possibilities:

Deletion: dp[i-1][j] + 1 (cost of deleting the character s1[i-1])

Insertion: dp[i][j-1] + 1 (cost of inserting the character s2[j-1])

Substitution: dp[i-1][j-1] + cost (cost of substituting s1[i-1] with s2[j-1]). The cost is 0 if the characters are the same, and 1 if they are different.

Final Result: The minimum edit distance between the entire s1 and s2 is found at dp[m][n], where m and n are the respective lengths of the input strings.
